# About The Project
It is a **Docker-based sandbox environment** for running code snippets.Â For each piece of provided code, it builds a fresh Docker-based container, executes it, and then returns the results. The major programming languages C, C++, Python, Java, and javascript are supported, and more language support can be added.
It can also be used as a platform for interviews where the interviewer can create a special link or code. By using the specially constructed URL or code, a user may access the interview. The screen will be shared in real time after clicking on a specific link to start the interview. It implies that any modifications made to one screen will be reflected on all users' screens during that specific interview. They can use a video call at any time during the interview.
